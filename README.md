# SYK-model
Codes for studying the SYK model.

spectral-form-factor.nb: 
    1. import data from exact diagonalization of SYK Hamiltonian (raw data generated from the MATLAB codes in this                      repository),
    2. calcualte average adjacent level spacing ratio,
    3. unfold the spectra (slow, should translate to MATLAB codes)
    4. calculate and plot the unfolded and connected spectral form factor(slow, should translate to MATLAB codes).
